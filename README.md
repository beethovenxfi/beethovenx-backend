## Project setup

### Prepare .env file

Rename `env.local` file to `.env`.

For the sanity content to work, you need to set
the `SANITY_API_TOKEN`.

### Generate gql types

There are 2 kinds of graphql types to generate. We have types for interacting with the different subgraphs, and the types
for our exposed graphql api schema.
Run `yarn generate` to generate all gql types

### Setup empty database & Prisma

## Running with docker

```
docker compose up -d 
```

Viewing logs:
```
docker compose logs -f
```

#### Start docker container (or manually set up your database)

First we need to spin up the database, there is a `docker-compose` file with a postgres
database configured. Spin it up by running `docker-compose up -d`.

#### Apply prisma migrations

Run `yarn prisma migrate dev` to apply all database migrations.

#### Generate prisma client

Run `yarn prisma generate` to generate the prisma client. Usually this is already
done by applying the migrations

#### Run mutations to initialize fill database with intial data

Trigger the following mutations when you start from a clean DB:

```
poolSyncAllPoolsFromSubgraph
poolReloadStakingForAllPools
userInitWalletBalancesForAllPools
userInitStakedBalances
```

### Setup database & Prisma from backup

Retrieve the current pg_dump file under `https://api-db-dump.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/canary/api-dump.20230309`.
Dumps are kept for the previous 7 days, adjust the date in the URL (YYYYMMDD format) to receive the desired dump.

Run `docker-compose up -d` to start the database via docker compose.

Retrieve the docker container ID through `docker ps`.

Run `docker exec -i <container-ID> /bin/bash -c "PGPASSWORD=let-me-on psql --username backend beetx" < /path/on/your/machine/dump`
with the container-ID from the step before.

## Run locally

`yarn start:local`
You can do this by sending the following GraphQL command to the server:

```
mutation init {
  poolSyncAllPoolsFromSubgraph
  poolReloadStakingForAllPools(stakingTypes: [MASTER_CHEF, GAUGE, RELIQUARY, FRESH_BEETS])
  userInitWalletBalancesForAllPools
  userInitStakedBalances(stakingTypes: [MASTER_CHEF, GAUGE, RELIQUARY, FRESH_BEETS])
}
```

With the following HTTP headers:
```
{"AdminApiKey": "key-you-set-in-env-file"}
```

### Start a local server

```
yarn start:local
```

## Branching and deployment environments

We run a canary and a production (called main) deployment environment.
The canary environment is built from the `v2-canary` branch and the production deployment
is built from the `v2-main` branch. The environments can be accessed through the following links:

https://backend-v2.beets-ftm-node.com/graphql

https://backend-v2-canary.beets-ftm-node.com/graphql

## CDK

This repository contains CDK scripts to setup a full backend system on AWS. 

### Configure

The following need to be set in your AWS account:

`githubToken` secret - In secrets manager create a new secret called GITHUB_TOKEN Which contains a Github oAuth token. See [this document](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codepipeline/latest/userguide/appendix-github-oauth.html#GitHub-create-personal-token-CLI) to create this token, then add it to secrets manager as `githubToken`


## Contributing

We follow the model of [gitflow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow) using the following naming for branches:

-   main: v2-main
-   development: v2-canary
-   feature: feature/\*
-   release: release/\*
-   hotfix: hf/\*

To contribute, branch from `v2-canary` (which is our development branch) and open a PR against `v2-canary` once the feature is complete. It will be reviewed and eventually merged into v2-canary.
